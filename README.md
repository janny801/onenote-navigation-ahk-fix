# OneNote Horizontal Scroll & Panning (Windows 11, AutoHotkey)

**Enhances OneNote navigation on Windows with horizontal scrolling and middle-click panning.**

This AutoHotkey script brings back two essential features that are missing in OneNote Desktop App for Windows but standard in other applications:

- **Shift + Scroll Wheel** for horizontal scrolling  
- **Middle Mouse Button drag** for smooth panning

The script only activates when OneNote is the active window. It’s lightweight, non-intrusive, and includes optional visual feedback (cursor and origin marker). Setup is quick, and you can optionally run it at startup.

## Features

- Horizontal scrolling with **Shift + Scroll Wheel**
- Click-and-drag navigation with the **Middle Mouse Button**
- **Visual feedback**: directional pan cursor and origin marker
- Only affects OneNote (won’t interfere with other apps)
