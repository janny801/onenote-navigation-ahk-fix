# OneNote Horizontal Scroll & Panning (Windows 11, AutoHotkey)

**Enhances OneNote navigation on Windows with horizontal scrolling and middle-click panning.**

This AutoHotkey script brings back two essential features that are missing in OneNote Desktop App for Windows but standard in other applications:

- **Shift + Scroll Wheel** for horizontal scrolling  
- **Middle Mouse Button drag** for smooth panning

The script only activates when OneNote is the active window. Itâ€™s lightweight, non-intrusive, and includes optional visual feedback (cursor and origin marker). Setup is quick, and you can optionally run it at startup.
